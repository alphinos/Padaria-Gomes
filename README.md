## - [ ] **Object Oriented Programming** :green_circle:
* The first project that involves java for the "Linguagens de Programação II"'s subject.
* I used a lot of OOP concepts on the Thauxi project without knowing.
* Here, I am learning properly how to do the things with OOP.
* The project is composed by the product class, the store class and the seller class.
* The formatter class is just a helper to print more easily on the screen.

As the license suggests, everything here is on public domain so you can use the code and everythng.
Thank you :D
